user authentication 
allauth > package cover all user authentication 
Django default auth :-
django.contrib.auth.urls
startapp accounts 
add it to settings
from the doc get the django app url to the main url 
this will explore the app urls 
MOZILLA DOCUMENTATION
you need to create html files for each url 
create registeration folder 
login.html 
password_reset_email.html
logged_out.html
password_reset_form.html
password_reset_done.html > copy from other
password_reset_complete.html
password_change_form.html > copy from other 
at the settings add variable to send email
EMAIL_BACKEND = ....etc.
remove all blocks and extends 
move the accounts app in installed apps to the top
in order to avoid the admin default pages 
signup and manage profile :-
baseuser model: this will over write all django defaults 
abstractbaseuser model: this replace only the user not groups and others 

extend: the easiest way, this will link one-to-one between the django user default and your 
new coded user model 
accounts > model :-
add the fields whatever you want extra to the defaults 
add the default fields and link it one to one 
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
user = models.Foreignkey(User ....etc.)
makemigrations migrate 
register model in the admin 
now you can create profile and link it to one of the default django user
but we have to code, if we created in django admin it create new profile automatically 
we have to use django signals post_save
on new user creation send signal to create profile in accounts app 
import post_save & receiver 


-----------------------------------------
